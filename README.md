# Mini-CAD(1.0)
## Introduction
The project draws the function image that you enter on the command-line interface.and it will change with the result.It is accessible to use function like exp,sin,fabs and so on.

### Notice
The graphics I use is ACLlib,a header file that supplied by Zhejiang University.And in order to run this program, you should also download the ACLlib.h and ACLlib.c.

This version is used for my C programming class.Until now,my project only works out on condition that you use VS.I am a new learner,and I will do more improvement.

Take the PC ppi into consideration.
